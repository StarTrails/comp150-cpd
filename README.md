# COMP150 - Reflective Journal to Accompany My CPD Report

## Week 0

Induction Week and the Robot Olympiad

In this first week of university the games design and programming students participated in the Robot Olympiad. This involved creating Lego machines and programming them to commit certain tasks that have been decided for us. We were separated into small teams for this. I got to meet and work together with 3 other students which was a great opportunity for developing team work skills and getting used to the idea of collaborating with work. 
We also got to meet our games academy staff this week and got a idea of how the first term would be. 

## Week 1

From Concepts to Design and Commerce, An Introduction to Python Programming and PyGame, and Computing Fundamentals

In this week we started our 3 modules for the term i will speak about my experience this week with each separately.

In our first Comp-120 session we have starting programming in python in assorted pairs throughout the class. learning python and completing our assigned tasks was alot easier in pairs as the experience throughout the class differs greatly.   

In our First Comp-150 session we split into assigned groups and had to create a game concept using creativity cards and then create a 30 second elevator pitch for that game idea. We also spoke alot about target audiences and pitching our games towards certain audiences. 

Comp-110 started off with a lecture about The history of computation and Notional machines. All though it was a very dry session overall not to my taste it offered alot of new information for me to absorb.


## Week 2

Tinkering Graphics, the Agile Philosophy, and Journal Articles in Computing

This week in comp-150 our class has been creating a 2D game idea individually and creating a presentation for it that we will then show to our peers at a later date. My idea is called Somnus a 2D dungeon crawler.

in Comp-120 We have been learning about digital images and how to write programs that manipulate the colour of a given image. I found this session quite interesting and have been told it makes creating colour palletes for games alot easier.  

## Week 3

Starting my Tinkering Graphics Assignment, Pitching my First Game Concept, and Version Control

It's the week for comp-150 presentations and i had to present my game idea Somnus in front of my class. I initally gathered it would be a hard sell as the turnbased genre is a decaying one. I feel it went quite well but my idea did not get funded to be continued in groups (actually was one of the worst funding wise). But I will say that it was a great experience all around.

In comp-120 we spent the lesson learning about manipulating pixels on the surface of a image. this included decreasing the amount of a certain colour within a picture and calculating colour distance in a image.

Comp-110 Session this week kicked off our WorksheetB assignment which involves creating psuedocode and Flowcharts that showcase how a program works.   

## Week 4

Met my Team for the Game Development Project! More Programming and Learning about Logic and Academic Writing

In comp-120 We learned alot more interesting programming tricks involving images. One of these involves mirroring images and another involves creating image collages. The Tinkering Graphics assignment was also being worked on this week quite a bit my pair chose the map generator contract and it seems to be going alright. 

In Comp-150 We were put into our groups top work on our first big game project in Pygame. I was put in team colossus to work on a turn bases 4x game known as Pillars.

In Comp-110 This week we had a lecture about Logic gates followed by a review of Worksheet B. This involves looking at my peers work and examples of doing the work well as shown by our lecturer.  

## Week 5

Peer-review finished and first assignment finished! Learned more about academic writing and complexity theory

Comp-110 this week involved Computation complexity and learning to use the "Big o" notation. This week we also recieved Worksheet C which involves explaining an algorithms purpose and writing about time complexity in big-o notation.

Comp-120  our classes did a Peer review for our tinkering graphics contract. as i stated earlier me and my pair programmed the map generation contract and although it worked by the review it was really badly made. it takes about 300 lines of code for such a simple map generation task and our peers reviewing it mentioned it alot.

Comp-150 had a big focus on academic writing this week. Most importantly learning about formats such as LaTeX and referencing our work with BiBTex. apart from this our team continued working on our Pillars project.

## Week 6

Spent the week with my team working in the studio! Made a lot of progress on the game...

This week was the studio practice week for our team to work on the pillars project. Things were a little hectic and getting people in everyday proved to be a bit challenging. after the week we managed to get map generation and booting menu's working correctly.

## Week 7

and so on...

Comp-150 included more work on academic writing with us learning about agile research practices and had more studio practice to continue with work on our game in the week.

Comp-120 was our first session on tinkering audio and boy was it initially confusing. Found it alot harder to grasp than the previous tinkering graphics sessions.

Comp-110 session was mostly about mathematics and how it applys greatly computing. alot of info about algebra and geometry. The session ended with a worksheet c review.  

## Week 8

and so on...

Comp-110 this week started with a Peer review of our current drafts of the research journal followed by a lecture on basic data structures such as arrays and linked lists. As normal for me i find comp 110 quite dry but full of useful programming information. 

Comp-120 The second week of tinkering audio was focused on Tone generation. My pair has had some initial issues with learning about tinkering audio as it seems alot harder to grasp than the previous contract.

Comp-150 The first session involved a peer review for the academic essay initial drafts. This included a lecture on assessing criteria for scholarly papers. This lecture will be very helpful for written academic work ( currently a weak point for me). 
  

## Week 9

and so on...

Comp-150 CPD review this week to see how the class is doing on writing their weekly development report. We have also been given our new teams that we are working with for our next project in the 2nd term. 

Comp-120 lesson was mostly about synthesizer's and writing programs that can create a melody out of a musical notation. our pair has started to get to grips with understanding how to use audio within programming correctly and is now working towards completing our audio assignment.

## Week 10

and so on...

Comp-150  This was the live demonstration week for the game that I was working on with team colossus. Unfortunately it didn't go as well as expected alot of issues with the build character couldn't even move correctly across the screen. But we got through the presentation and took the criticism on the chin.  

Comp-120 The tinkering audio assignment peer review was this week. We were a bit behind on our contract so we didn't receive the best reviews for it but we got a lot of direction from other students to help us on the assignment.

Comp-110 A lecture about computer architecture and compilers and interpreter's.  

## Week 11

and so on...

Comp-150 This session was focused on learning more advanced version control techniques. A good section of this was a workshop focused on branching which I found very useful to take part in. We also took a look at unit testing with TravisCI 

Comp-120 This week was very great for me. We started our first lesson on the unreal engine. This included looking at the differences programming wise between c++ and python. We also started to work on creating a game demo in unreal engine.

Comp-110 2nd lecture on data structures. this time focused on more advanced data structures such as trees and DAGS. sadly i can't talk much more on this as i missed the main lecture. 

## Week 12

and so on...

Comp-150 In this session our new team with our fellow BA students demonstrated our new game project that will be developed in unreal engine. We chose a top down shooting game known currently as blastback. I believe the presentation also went quite well which i'm quite happy about.

Comp-120 In this session we did our last lesson of unreal introduction before the christmas holidays. Most of it included learning how to use c++ with blueprints in a FPS demo that we followed along with.

Comp-110 This session was a second session focused almost entirely on mathematics and applying it to computing.
