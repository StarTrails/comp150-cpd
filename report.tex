\section{Introduction}
In this document I will be talking about my experiences in the first term at university and skills that i wish to improve on throughout the year ahead of me.
Although i currently do not have a strict career path in mind for my future within the games industry I am very interested in taking part in the creation of games in general. The skills that I will be talking about in this review are academic writing structuring, sharing and critiquing work, creating and maintaining schedule's effectively and further development of programming knowledge.   

\section{Academic writing structuring}

Write about 200 words about. Remember, this is should be reflective and personal to you. Justify the relevance and importance of each of these skills with insight into your personal goals and personal circumstances. Assess your application of the skill throughout the semester and critically reflect on upon their impact it has had on your work and the challenges/obstacles. Acknowledge difficulties. Then, suggest how to overcome the challenge/obstacle in relation to a SMART action. When planning such actions, do not be too general. Consider SMART actions:
specific; measurable; achievable; relevant; and time-bound. Ensure that your proposed action for future development meets all five of these criteria.

\section{Sharing and critiquing}

During our group project for this term i have found that being able to communicate effectively in a team environment is very important. Especially when it comes to critiquing lack of or lower quality work but being constructive enough that it doesn't strongly offend the creator. 

\section{Creating and Maintaining Schedule's effectively}

Write about 200 words. As above.

\section{Developing Programming knowledge}

Write about 200 words. As above.


\section{Conclusion}

Write your conclusion here. Though the conclusion should be brief, no more than 100 words, it should do more than merely summarise the report. Focus on the five SMART actions that you intend to take in order to overcome any challenges and/or obstacles. Contextualise how this will help you towards your intended career goal and how this may improve your project for the next semester.
